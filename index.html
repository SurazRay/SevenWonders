            <h3> 1st Wonder : Petra, Jordan
            </h3>
            <p>The ancient city of <u>Petra</u> , Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone
                mountains and
                cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later
                the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this time it flourished, becoming an
                important trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings,
                temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they
                constructed a water system that allowed for lush gardens and farming.</p>

            <h3> 2nd Wonder : Machu Picchu, Peru </h3>
            <p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who believed it was
                Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish
                rule.Although that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars.
                Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of
                chastity. Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat.

            <h3> 3rd Wonder : Christ the Redeemer, Rio de Janeiro </h3>
            <p>
                <u> Christ the Redeemer </u>, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro.
                Its
                origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.”They
                proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul
                Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later. The resulting monument stands
                98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its base.

            <h3> 4th Wonder : Colosseum, Rome </h3>
            <p>
                <u> The Colosseum </u>in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat
                of
                engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system
                of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most
                notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was
                sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements.

            <h3> 5th Wonder : Taj Mahal, Agra</h3>
            <p>
                This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is
                perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58)
                to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th
                child. It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense
                garden with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones
                in geometric and floral patterns.

            <h3> 6th Wonder : Chichén Itzá, Mexico </h3>
            <p>
                <u> Chichén Itzá </u>is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and
                10th
                centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of
                important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo
                (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’
                astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar
                year.

            <h3> 7th Wonder : Great Wall of China, naer Beijing </h3>
            <p>
                The <u> Great Wall of China </u> is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed
                Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th century BCE
                and continued for two millennia.Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel
                walls for lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great
                thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness.
